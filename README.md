# Computer Vision with ML5
This is a project done in fulfilment of CM2025 Graphics Programming module. The project involves image processing, motion detection, face recognition and hand gesture recognition.

**Live View**: https://jiathehuman.github.io/Computer-vision-with-ML5/

## üì¢ Key Features

- Image processing techniques such as colour segmentation and colour lerping
- Motion detection
- Hand gestures (thumb up, thumb down) detection with ML5's HandPose API
- Face detection with ML5's pre-trained FaceAPI

## **Instructions**
Start: Press "s" on keyboard to start the program.
To traverse through face filters (Lower Left box): Press "1 to 4" on keyboard.
1 : Greyscale Filter
2 : Blur Filter
3 : Color Space Filter
4 : Pixelated Filter
  
## ü§ñ Technical Highlights

Through this project, I learned how to use pre-trained APIs, how to synthesise graphics and how to process visual signals. I learned about the mathematical ideas that underpin digital representations of graphics. I also learned the basics of working with simulated physics by creating a Snooker ssimulator. (Check <a href = "https://github.com/jiathehuman/snooker-game-with-matterjs">here</a>.)

## üí° Future Plans <br>
Looking ahead, I plan to use ML5's Body Pose API to create more interactive features.

## Detecting facial boundaries
By processing the pixels within the detected facial boundaries, we can apply a filter over our faces. <br>

## Detecting hand gestures
By detecting the position between the ring finger and the thumb, we can deduce whether the hand is doing a thumbs up or thumbs down gesture. <br>
